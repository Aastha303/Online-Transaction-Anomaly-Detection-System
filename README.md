# 🛡️ Online Transaction Anomaly Detection System

An end-to-end Machine Learning application that detects potentially fraudulent online transactions using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, batch and single-transaction prediction, and an interactive Streamlit web application.

> **Note:** This project uses a **risk-based proxy fraud label** generated from transaction patterns for demonstration purposes. It is intended as a portfolio project and not for production banking systems.

# 📊 Feature Engineering

The following engineered features are created during preprocessing:

- Relative Transaction Amount
- High Amount Flag
- High Relative Amount Flag
- Unknown Location Flag
- Late Night Transaction Flag
- Invalid Time Flag
- Log Transaction Amount
- Transaction Hour
- Transaction Minute

---

# 🤖 Model

Algorithm Used:

- Support Vector Machine (RBF Kernel)

Why SVM?

- Strong performance on non-linear classification
- Effective on medium-sized datasets
- Good generalization ability
- High recall for suspicious transaction detection

---

# 📈 Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC Score

Evaluation metrics are automatically saved in:

```
models/metadata.json
```

# 🧪 Running the Project

## 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Online-Transaction-Anomaly-Detection-System.git

cd Online-Transaction-Anomaly-Detection-System
```

---

## 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 3. Train Model

```bash
python train.py
```

This generates:

- svm_model.joblib
- scaler.joblib
- imputer.joblib
- metadata.json

---

## 4. Launch Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

# 📥 Batch Prediction

The application allows users to upload a CSV file containing multiple transactions.

Output:

- Fraud Probability
- Prediction Label

Users can download the scored CSV directly from the application.

# 📌 Dataset

This project uses a **synthetic transaction dataset** created specifically for this portfolio project.

The dataset simulates online financial transactions with intentionally introduced:

- Missing values
- Invalid timestamps
- Noisy formatting
- Different transaction types
- Multiple device types
- Multiple locations

to demonstrate a realistic preprocessing and anomaly detection workflow.

---

# ⚠️ Limitations

- The fraud labels are **proxy labels** generated using predefined risk rules.
- The dataset is synthetic and intended for educational purposes.
- A production fraud detection system would require verified historical fraud labels and continuous model monitoring.

---

# 🔮 Future Improvements

- Deep Learning Models
- XGBoost Comparison
- Explainable AI (SHAP)
- Real-time API Deployment
- Database Integration
- User Authentication
- Model Monitoring Dashboard
